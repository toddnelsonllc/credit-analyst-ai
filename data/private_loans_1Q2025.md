(1)Due to the nature of private loans, external agency credit ratings may not be readily available. Where appropriate, the Company obtains non-published credit ratings from one or more third-party rating agencies, which are determined based on an independent evaluation of the transaction. For other loans without published or private credit ratings, the Company assigns internal risk ratings, based on its investment selection and monitoring process and policies. These internal risk ratings are categorized as “Unrated” above.
